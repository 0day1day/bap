Missing features:
* CFG coalescing
* (Re)implement constant propagation, possibly in SCCVN.
* Rebuild compond expressions when converting back from SSA. (mostly (overly?) done)
* SMT-LIB input/output.
* C output.
* Forward symbolic evaluator.

Disassembly stuff:
* .plt disassembles poorly. Into this.
* Include symbols in disassembly
* Include section names in disassembly
* Handle unsupported instructions better, particularly hlt.


Design issues:
* Finish visit_action.
* Do we want to leave visit_binding in there?

Other:
* Fix up documentation.
* Write more .mli files.
* Test on/port to OSX
* Examples/demo.
* Redo the patched VEX thing properly.

Bigger projects:
* Move VEX2IL translation into ocaml. (leaving only a small shim layer for bfd)
* Add support for AMD64 binaries. (after completing the previous item)
* Update the Vine regression tests to work with BAP and/or write new ones.
* Trace reader for TEMU traces or some better way of getting traces. (maybe PIN)
