Missing features:
* CFG coalescing
* Rebuild compond expressions when converting back from SSA. (mostly (overly?) done)
* SMT-LIB input/output.
* C output.
* Forward symbolic evaluator.
* VSA (value set analysis)
* Constant cjmps
* Update target on indirect constant jumps

Disassembly stuff:
* .plt disassembles poorly. Into this.
* Include symbols in disassembly
* Include section names in disassembly
* Handle unsupported instructions better, particularly hlt.


Design issues:
* Finish visit_action.
* Do we want to leave visit_binding in there?
* Change attributes from attribute list to a set of attribute.
* When optimizing code, try to keep the more meaningful variable names.

Other:
* Have example demos of the tools.
* Fix up documentation.
* Write more .mli files.
* Test on/port to OSX
* Examples/demo.
* Redo the patched VEX thing properly. (using a vendor branch)
* Improve Cfg_ast.to_prog with regards to adding BB_Entry to a trace. See
  wp_test_3.il for an example where it is not ideal.


Bigger projects:
* Move VEX2IL translation into ocaml. (leaving only a small shim layer for bfd)
* Add support for AMD64 binaries. (after completing the previous item)
* Update the Vine regression tests to work with BAP and/or write new ones.
* Trace reader for TEMU traces or some better way of getting traces. (maybe PIN)
