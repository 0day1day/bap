Disassembly:
* Include symbols in disassembly
* Include section names in disassembly
* Include data?

Design issues:
* Change attributes from attribute list to a set of attribute.
* When optimizing code, try to keep the more meaningful variable names.
* Inter-procedural analysis

Features:
* Function boundary identification for x86-64
* Enable (re-)lifting of resolved indirect jumps in BIL

Other:
* Fix up documentation.
* Write more .mli files.
* Depgraphs.ml: Make a separate graph type for depgraphs.ml with
   Lang.exp = unit
* Cfg.mli: How can we make expressions more structured?
* Should we add edge conditions to the visitor?
* Do we really want to_astvar and to_astloc? I don't think we are
  using them right now.
