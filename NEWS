New in BAP 0.2:

* Temporaries introduced in SSA can be removed when converting back to the AST.
* Added constant folding and algebraic simplifications to SCCVN.
* Added a simple interface in Ssa_simp to apply all safe optimizations easily.
* Changed REG_{1,8,16,32,64} to Reg of int so there is less special casing.
* Added Control Dependence Graphs again.
* Syntax errors now include line numbers.
* Added memory2array.
* Makefile now recompiles utils when library changes.
* Removed unneeded jump instructions when lifting code.
* Fixed a problem in Cfg_ast.to_prog.
* Fixed a bug in unsigned division.
* Temporarily stopped using -pack to work around problems with ocamldebug.
