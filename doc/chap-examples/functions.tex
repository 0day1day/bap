\section{Functions}

In this tutorial, we show how to use the \texttt{get\_functions}
command to extract functions from a binary.  Specifically, we will
look at the \cmdline{/bin/ls} command.  For the purposes of this
example, make sure you have a version of the binary with symbols; the
version that comes with your distribution probably had its symbols
stripped.  If we know the name of a function we want to extract, such
as \cmdline{hash\_table\_ok}, we can extract it using
\cmdline{get\_functions -unroll 3 /bin/ls hash\_table\_ok}.  This will
produce a file called \texttt{resolvehash\_table\_ok.il}. We used the
\cmdline{-unroll} option to remove loops by unrolling; this is
important when generating VCs, because generating VCs is generally
only possible for acyclic programs. If we wanted to see if the
function can return zero, we could use topredicate:
\cmdline{topredicate -q -il resolvehash\_table\_ok.il -post
  'R\_EAX\_32:u32 == 0:u32' -stp-out /tmp/f -solve}.
