\section{Obtaining \bap}
Please email David Brumley to get the current \bap URL and credentials.
We currently distribute \bap as a VMWare virtual machine. We
distribute \bap in a virtual machine for several reasons. First, \bap
has quite a few dependencies, thus setup is potentially
complex. Second, while we do not provide support, issues that we
choose to resolve can be done more quickly when we know the exact
setup.
