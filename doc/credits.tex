\chapter{Credits}
\bap is currently maintained mostly by Ivan Jager.  \bap is a complete
rewrite of work David Brumley conducted for his thesis. That work was
called \vine. Contributors to the original Vine code include: Juan
Caballero, Cody Hartwig, Ivan Jager, Eric Li, James Newsome, Pongsin
Poosankam, and Heng Yin. Dawn Song was David's advisor, and provided
funds, food, support, and many other things that made Vine (thus \bap)
possible.
