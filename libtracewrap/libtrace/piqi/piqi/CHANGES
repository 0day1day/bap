Piqi 0.5.5 (April 12, 2011)
===========================

Highlights:

  - Multi-format data serialization for Erlang (JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers)
  - Piqi-RPC -- an RPC-over-HTTP system for Erlang
  - Support for XML encoding
  - Function definitions in the Piqi language
  - Piqi getopt -- type-based command-line arguments parsing

Backward-incompatible changes:

  - "piqirun" Erlang application is renamed to "piqi" (contains the old
    "piqirun.erl" and some new functionality). The new application runs a
    supervisor and some servers which are used by Piqi-RPC and multi-format data
    serialization (see below).

  - (piqic ocaml, piqic erlang) Both Piqi compilers now generate
    "<Mod>_piqi.ml|.erl|.hrl" instead of "<Mod>.ml|.erl|.hrl". For OCaml it is
    still possible to specify the name of the output file explicitly using "-o"
    parameter. OCaml and Erlang module names can be also set using
    "ocaml-module" and "erlang-module" directly in the .piqi file.

  - (ocaml) Generated OCaml serialization functions (i.e. gen_<typename>) now
    accept 1 arguments instead of 2. Old functions accepting 2 arguments are
    renamed to gen__<typename>. The removed argument is an integer tag for a
    Protobuf field -- there's rarely a need to specify it explicitly.

Important changes in Erlang serialization:

  - Generated Erlang serialization functions (i.e. gen_<type>/2) can also accept
    only 1 argument. It is now possible to use gen_<type>(X) instead of
    gen_<type>('undefined', X).

  - Calling piqirun:init_from_binary/1 is no longer necessary as all
    parse_<typename>/1 functions will accept Erlang binaries.

Other changes:

  - (piqirun-erlang) Improved error reporting when deserializing incomplete
    data: a special 'not_enough_data' exception will be thrown in such case.
  - (json) Wrapping top-level primitive values into {"_": <value>} object to
    conform with JSON RFC4627 specification.
  - Piqi-light syntax improvements for better readability.
  - Don't generate {<field>: null} for optional fields missing in JSON records.
  - Tests will now work even if Protocol Buffers is not installed.
  - (piqirun-ocaml) Remove "Stream" layer and use channels directly in the input
    buffer.

Bug fixes:

  - (erlang) Fixed incorrect Erlang mapping for some built-in types (problem was
    introduced in 0.5.4 release).
  - (erlang) A proper support for records with no fields.
  - (piqic ocaml) crash on imports of built-in aliases (Issue #2).
  - (make ocaml-install) Fixed installation of OCaml libraries which conflicted
    with installation of OCaml dependencies (Issue #1).

New functionality (XML support):
  - "piqi convert" can now convert data between Protobuf, XML, JSON and Piq
    formats. Other Piqi commands that rely on conversion functionality, such as
    "piqi getopt", can work with XML as well.

New functionality (XML, JSON and Piq serialization for Erlang):

  - "piqic-erlang-ext" -- a command-line Piqi compiler (an extended version of
    "piqic erlang" command). It generates Erlang code for
    serializing/deserializing data XML, JSON, Piq, Protobuf formats.
  - piqi_tools.erl -- Erlang bindings for Piqi tools implemented as Erlang
    port running "piqi server".

New functionality (miscellaneous):

  - Support for serializing top-level values of primitive types (ocaml, erlang,
    piqi tools, all formats).
  - (piqirun-erlang, piqirun-ocaml) New functions for encoding/decoding
    length-delimited blocks (gen_block/parse_block). Compatible with similar
    functionality in Protocol Buffers.
  - (piqic-ocaml, piqic-erlang) Support for generating default values for types:
    'piqic ocaml|erlang --gen-defaults ...'.
  - A new "piqi getopt" command interprets idiomatic command-line arguments as
    Piq data object (according to a Piqi type spec) and converts it to JSON,
    XML, Piq and Protobuf formats.
  - Piqi-RPC -- an PRC-over-HTTP system for Erlang (see below).
  - Performance tests for Erlang serialization to/from Protobuf, JSON, XML, Piq.

New functionality (Piqi-RPC):

  - Support for function definitions in the Piqi language, all the Piqi tools,
    compilers, OCaml, Erlang and Protocol Buffer mappings.
  - A new "piqi server" command that talks Piqi-RPC over Unix pipe and exposes
    data conversion functionality.
  - A new "piqi call" -- Piqi-RPC command-line client that interprets
    command-line arguments as input parameters for remote functions and
    communicates with Piqi-RPC servers via HTTP or Unix pipe.
  - piqi-rpc -- an Erlang application containing runtime support libraries and
    HTTP interface for Piqi-RPC.
  - "piqic-erlang-rpc" -- a command-line Piqi compiler and server stubs
    generator for Piqi-RPC/Erlang.
  - A new "piqic expand" command. It is similar to "piqi expand" but also sets
    piqic-specific fields, such as OCaml and Erlang names.


Piqi 0.5.4 (December 19, 2010)
==============================

Now it is possible to embed Piqi type definitions into Piq streams to produce
self-describing data bundles. Piq streams with embedded type definitions can be
represented in Piq, Piq-JSON and Wire formats.

Piqi tools:

  - New "piqi convert --embed-piqi" flag for embedding type information into
    serialized Piq streams.
  - Use hash-based wire codes for Piqi self-specification instead of
    automatically-assigned ordinals to ensure forward and backward compatibility
    of serialized .piqi specs with regard to future Piqi language extensions.
  - Many internal improvements in Piqi compiler compiler, Piqi library
    initialization and serialization of .piqi specs.

piqic:

  - (ocaml, erlang) Generating more optimal code for variant parsing.

Bug fixes:

  - Fixed an integer overflow bug in piqirun-ocaml library on 32-bit platform.
  - Fixed missing location information in errors or warnings while converting
    from JSON.
  - Fixed incorrect field ordering during Piq input/output when Piqi
    specification explicitly defines non-ordinal wire codes.


Piqi 0.5.3 (October 19, 2010)
=============================

Added initial support for Piqi-light -- lightweight EBNF-like syntax for Piqi
data definition language.

Piqi tools:

  - New "piqi light" command for printing .piqi in Piqi-light syntax.
  - Improved pretty-printing of .piqi by transforming output Piq AST. Mainly
    affects "piqi expand".
  - Added support for "-o" option to "piqi to-proto", "piqi of-proto" commands.
  - Improved floats reversibility in Piq (unified this part with JSON
    generator). Affects "proto convert -t piq".

piqic:

  - (ocaml) Simplified generated OCaml type definitions.

Bug fixes:

  - Timely reset location DB to allow garbage collection of objects. Affects
    "piqi convert" and "piqi pp".
  - Fixed several problems with "piqi expand".
  - Fixed printing order for "unknown field" warnings.


Piqi 0.5.2 (September 13, 2010)
===============================

Added Erlang support:

  - "piqic erlang" -- a new piqic backend for for generating Erlang type
    specifications and encoding/decoding functions.
  - "piqirun-erlang" -- runtime support library.

piqic:

  - (ocaml, erlang) Normalize Piqi identifiers by default, i.e. convert
    "CamlCase" identifiers to "caml-case".
  - (ocaml, erlang) Don't generate codecs and types for unused defintions from
    the boot module.

piqirun-ocaml:

  Backward incompatible changes:

  - Combined piqirun-ocaml library into one "piqirun" OCaml module (previously
    there were two: "piqirun_gen" and "piqirun_parse").
  - Improved piqirun-ocaml buffer initialization interface (unified it with
    piqirun-erlang).

  Other changes:

  - Ignore duplicate fields instead of producing an error.

Piqi tools:

  - Generate warnings instead of errors on duplicate fields when reading from
    Piq format.
  - Ignore duplicate fields when reading from wire format.

Platform support:

  - Now builds and runs on Mac OS X (fixed some build portability problems).


Piqi 0.5.1 (August 17, 2010)
============================

Major changes include support for JSON encoding and providing compatibility
with OCaml 3.12.0.

Piqi tools:

  - "piqi convert" command now supports two new encodings: "json" (plain JSON)
    and "piq-json" (JSON with Piq type annotation for top-level objects).
  - A new command: "piqi json-pp" for pretty-printing JSON files.

Piqi language:

  - Added support for "json-name" property for type definitions, fields and
    options. When specified, it will be used as a name for correspondent JSON
    field names instead of "name".
  - Renamed "ignore-field" top-level directive to "custom-field".

Other changes:

  - Provided compatibility with the latest OCaml release (3.12.0). Improved
    support for older OCaml versions >= 3.10.


Piqi 0.5.0 (July 9, 2010)
=========================

First public release.
