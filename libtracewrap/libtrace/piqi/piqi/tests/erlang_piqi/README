Compile complex Piqi specification "piqi.org/piqi.piqi" to produce Erlang coders
and decoders.

Then build a program which reads and writes back a serialized binary object
which happens to be the serialized "piqi.piqi" specification itself.

Also testing Piqi imports in Erlang by compiling and linking "piqobj.piqi" which
imports "piqtype.piqi"

NOTE: "piqtype.erl" is required for "piqi.erl", since "piqi.piqi" uses "piq-any"
type which implicitly requires "piqtype.erl" when compiled to .erl.
