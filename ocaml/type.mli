(** Type declarations for BAP.

type label = 
  | Name of string (** For named labels*)
  | Addr of int64 (** For addresses. Cast REG_type as unsigned when comparing. *)


(** The IR type of a BAP expression *)
type typ =
  | Reg of int (** an N-bit bitvector (use 1 for booleans). Currently supported values: 1,8,16,32,64 *)
  | TMem of typ (** Memory of given index type and endianness*)
  | Array  of typ * typ (** Array of index type, element type. *)


(** Different forms of casting *)
type cast_type =
  | CAST_UNSIGNED (** 0-padding widening cast. *)
  | CAST_SIGNED (** Sign-extending widening cast. *)
  | CAST_HIGH (** Narrowning cast. Keeps the high bits. *)
  | CAST_LOW (** Narrowing cast. Keeps the low bits. *)

(** Binary operations implemented in the IR *)
type binop_type =
  | PLUS (** Integer addition. (commutative, associative) *)
  | MINUS (** Subtract second integer from first. *)
  | TIMES (** Integer multiplication. (commutative, associative)*)
  | DIVIDE (** Unsigned integer division. *)
  | SDIVIDE (** Signed integer division. *)
  | MOD (** Unsigned modulus. *)
  | SMOD (** Signed modulus. *)
  | LSHIFT (** Left shift. *)
  | RSHIFT (** Right shift, fill with 0. *)
  | ARSHIFT (** Right shift, sign extend. *)
  | AND (** Bitwise and. (commutative, associative) *)
  | OR (** Bitwise or. (commutative, associative) *)
  | XOR (** Bitwise xor. (commutative, associative) *)
  | EQ (** Equals (commutative) (associative on booleans) *)
  | NEQ (** Not equals (commutative) (associative on booleans) *)
  | LT (** Unsigned less than *)
  | LE (** Unsigned less than or equal to *)
  | SLT (** Signed less than *)
  | SLE (** Signed less than or equal to *)
                  

(** Unary operations implemented in the IR *)
type unop_type =
  | NEG (** Negate (2's complement) *)
  | NOT (** Bitwise not *)


(** The position of a statement in a source file *)
type pos = (string * int)

(** Extra attributes we can add to things.
    There may be a nicer way to implement this. Basically any extra information
    about a statement can be saved by wrapping the statement inside an Attr
    statement.
 *)
type attribute = 
  | Pos of pos  (** The position of a statement in the source file *)
  | Asm of string
  | Address of int64
  | Liveout (** the variable assigned in this move should be considered live *)
  | StrAttr of string (** Generic printable and parseable attribute *)
  | ExnAttr of exn (** Generic extensible attribute, but no parsing *)

type attributes = attribute list

(** Different visiting actions to be used by visitors. 'a will be
    instantiated with [exp], [stmt], etc. *)

                           as it is. *)
    | `DoChildren      (** Continue with the children of this
                           node. Rebuild the node on return if any of

				   given one and do children  *)
(* FIXME: ChangeDoChildrenPost is fugly... find a better solution.
