*** Basic installation ****

Note: we primarily build bap on 64-bit Debian Lenny. It will
likely also work on ubuntu and 32-bit systems.

To build BAP on x86, do the following:
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make

On x86_64, instead of ./configure you may need ./configure CFLAGS=-DAMD64.

Configure should report any dependencies you do not have.  You can
satisfy most dependencies on Ubuntu 11.04 by running:

  $ sudo apt-get install ocaml ocaml-native-compilers ocaml-findlib camlidl \
    libocamlgraph-ocaml-dev libextlib-ocaml-dev binutils-dev automake \
    libcamomile-ocaml-dev

To compile the documentation, you also need
  $ sudo aptitude install texlive-base texlive-latex-base \
    texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended 

The following command will install build dependencies on Fedora Core 15:

  $ sudo yum install ocaml ocaml-ocamlgraph ocaml-findlib  \
   ocaml-camlidl-devel ocaml-ocamlgraph-devel ocaml-extlib \
   ocaml-camomile-devel ocaml-camomile-data                \
   ocaml-camlp4-devel automake binutils-devel gcc-c++

If you get an error that says there is an undefined reference to
'__stack_chk_fail', either you need to reconfigure with gcc set to
disable stack protection, or you have compiled part of the code 
with the stack protector and part without it, in which case you 
might have to enable it to finish compilation.
You can enable/disable the stack protector in gcc in the following way:
Disable: ./configure CC="gcc -fno-stack-protector" 
Enable: ./configure CC="gcc -fstack-protector"
Doing make clean first, will ensure that the whole platform gets 
compiled with the same flag


*** Valgrind's VEX library ****

BAP requires Valgrind's VEX library. We have included a patched
version of the VEX library in this distribution.   We have included
information on our patch under VEX/BAP.README.  We recommend you use
the version of VEX that is included.

It is possible to use a different version of VEX.  To do so, build
VEX, then use the --with-vex=<vex dir> configure option.



*** Optional: Making the documentation ***

Optionally you can also make the documentation by running: 'make doc'
in the ocaml directory.  The documentation will be generated under
ocaml/doc/bap/.  Note that ocaml documentation requires that the ocaml
source files be built properly first.

We have also provided a command line to view the ocaml file
dependencies. Run:
  $ make bap.dot
in the ocaml directory. The resulting file is a graphviz dot file
which can help you visualize how modules are related, e.g., run:
  $ dot -Tpdf bap.dot > bap.pdf
  $ xpdf bap.pdf
