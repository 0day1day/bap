*** Basic installation ****

We primarily build bap on Ubuntu Linux. It will likely also work on
Debian systems.

To build BAP on x86, do the following:
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make
-- or to make all and run unit tests after --
  $ make test

Configure should report any dependencies you do not have.  You can
satisfy most dependencies on Ubuntu 11.04/11.10 by running:

  $ sudo apt-get install ocaml ocaml-native-compilers ocaml-findlib camlidl \
    libocamlgraph-ocaml-dev libextlib-ocaml-dev binutils-dev automake \
    libcamomile-ocaml-dev otags libpcre3-dev camlp4-extra bison flex \
    zlib1g-dev libgmp3-dev g++ libbitstring-ocaml-dev libtool

XXX: Does this work for Debian too?

To build LLVM code generation, include:
   libllvm-ocaml-dev

On x86_64 add the following packages:
    gcc-multilib g++-multilib lib32z1-dev

To compile the documentation, you also need
  $ sudo aptitude install texlive-base texlive-latex-base \
    texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended

The following command will install build dependencies on Fedora Core 15:

  $ sudo yum install ocaml ocaml-ocamlgraph ocaml-findlib  \
   ocaml-camlidl-devel ocaml-ocamlgraph-devel ocaml-extlib \
   ocaml-camomile-devel ocaml-camomile-data                \
   ocaml-camlp4-devel automake binutils-devel gcc-c++

If you get an error that says there is an undefined reference to
'__stack_chk_fail', either you need to reconfigure with gcc set to
disable stack protection, or you have compiled part of the code
with the stack protector and part without it, in which case you
might have to enable it to finish compilation.
You can enable/disable the stack protector in gcc in the following way:
Disable: ./configure CC="gcc -fno-stack-protector"
Enable: ./configure CC="gcc -fstack-protector"
Doing make clean first, will ensure that the whole platform gets
compiled with the same flag


*** SMT Solvers ***

BAP interfaces with several SMT solvers which must be downloaded and
installed separately.  The solver utility must be in the executable
path to be available to BAP. The supported solvers are:
 * STP https://sites.google.com/site/stpfastprover/
 * cvc3 http://www.cs.nyu.edu/acsys/cvc3/
 * yices2 http://yices.csl.sri.com/
 * XXX: need to describe Z3 setup


*** Installing pin ***

The PIN trace tool is located in the pintraces/ directory. Because of licensing
reasons, we cannot distribute PIN with the trace tool. PIN must be extracted
inside of the traces directory; for instance, if the traces branch is located
in $PATH/traces, then PIN should be in $PATH/traces/pin. Running ./getpin.sh
from the $PATH/traces/pintraces directory will automatically download and
install PIN for Linux; the user is responsible for accepting the PIN license
agreements. On Windows, PIN must be downloaded and extracted by hand. The PIN
tool can be built by executing make in the $PATH/traces/experiemental directory.
On Windows, we reccomend using GNU Make for Windows
(http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) and Visual C++ 2010 express
(http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express).
After compilation, the PIN tool should exist in
$PATH/traces/pintraces/obj-ia32/gentrace.so (or gentrace.dll on Windows).



*** Optional: Making the documentation ***

Optionally you can also build the developer documentation by running:
'make doc' in the ocaml directory.  The documentation will be
generated under ocaml/doc/bap/.  Note that ocaml documentation
requires that the ocaml source files be built properly first.


*** Optional: Making unit tests ***

Build and run the unit tests tests:
$ make test
OR

$ cd tests && make && ./bap_test_suite

For verbose output, pass -verbose to bap_test_suite.
