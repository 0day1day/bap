- Add support for x86-64.
- Keep compatibility with TEMU where possible.
- Taint analysis support. Use XED2.

======================================================

Traces are file-backed, and sequential in nature. Due to this, traces are
generally write-once-read-many structures.

Two classes: TraceReader and TraceWriter.

TraceReader opens an existing trace file, and allows playback of the
trace.

TraceWriter creates a new trace and allows the user to insert frames into
the trace.


======================================================

The instruction cache does not record down the length of an
instruction. Thus when traces are being read, instruction bytes that are
fetched from the cache might have garbage bytes appended to them. The code
using the instruction bytes must thus be able to parse x86 machine code
properly and recognize where the instruction ends, and ignore anything
following it.
