This version of BAP includes a stripped down version of ocaml 3.12.
This is because the big int implementation in ML prior to version 3.12
did not include shifts.  Rather than make everyone upgrade, we'll just
build the newer big int implementation and use that until most people
can easily upgrade to 3.12.  We also include a version of batteries
that builds using this big int implementation, rather than using the
user's version.

We do need to keep a good chunk of the ocaml build system around.
This is because the big int implementation will build optimized
versions (e.g., in assembly) for different architectures.  The logic
for this is in the configure/Make scripts, so we can't just get rid of
them entirely.
