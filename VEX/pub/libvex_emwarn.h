/* VEX can sometimes generate code which returns to the dispatcher
   with the guest state pointer set to VEX_TRC_JMP_EMWARN.  This means
   that VEX is trying to warn Valgrind that it is doing imprecise
   emulation in some sense.  The guest's pseudo-register
   "guest_EMWARN" will hold a value of type VexEmWarn, which describes
   the nature of the warning.  Currently the limitations that are
   warned about apply primarily to floating point support.

   All guest states should have a 32-bit (UInt) guest_EMWARN pseudo-
   register, that emulation warnings can be written in to.

   Note that guest_EMWARN only carries a valid value at the jump
   marked as VEX_TRC_JMP_EMWARN.  You can't assume it will continue to
   carry a valid value from any amount of time after the jump.
